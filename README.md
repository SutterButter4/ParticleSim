# ParticleSim

A basic program to simulate clouds of particles under the influence of gravity.

##Goals: 
- Support various particle distributions by default
- Options to support CPU single core, multi core, gpu acceleration. 
- Simulate in real time, or render to file to be viewed later.
- Support for other fundamental forces(electrostatic, weak, strong).
